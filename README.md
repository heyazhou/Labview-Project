Blob Detection # Labview-Project

Blob DETECTION

LabVIEW is a graphical programming language widely used for Automation of large scale projects. The Vision Assistant Module is integrated to acquire and process Images for Image Processing and Computer Vision applications. A test image is accessed from a data set and then using the template, more blobs of the same shape is identified and counted. The blob Detection is performed on a collection of coins. The template of the shape is extracted using the HSI Intensity plane of the image. Then the shape detection is used as we can see the shape is circular for a coin. Morphological operation like Dilation was used for Segmentation. The morphological approach quantitatively describes operations effective for the shape of objects in an image. The count of the coins is then returned.
